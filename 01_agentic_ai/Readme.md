# Agentic AI

## 📘 Introduction

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to act autonomously and perform tasks with a degree of independent decision-making. Unlike traditional AI models that simply respond to input, **Agentic AI systems operate as agents**—capable of planning, reasoning, and interacting with their environment or other agents to achieve specific goals.

This repository serves as a foundational guide and codebase for understanding and working with Agentic AI, combining modern frameworks, tools, and real-world examples.
